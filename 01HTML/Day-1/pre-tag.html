<h2>Basics of Web Development.</h2>

<h3>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</h3>

<p>
  Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage. It provides the structure and
  content—headings, paragraphs, images, and links. It's the 'what' of your
  website. Without HTML, there's nothing to see.
</p>

<h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</h3>
<p>
  If HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the skin and clothes. It controls the visual
  presentation of your website—colors, fonts, layouts, and animations. CSS is
  the 'how it looks' part, transforming a plain HTML page into a beautiful and
  engaging experience.
</p>

<h3>JavaScript:</h3>
<p>
  This is where the magic happens! JavaScript brings your website to life with
  interactivity. Want a button to do something when clicked? Need a form to be
  validated? That's JavaScript's job. It's the 'how it behaves' part, making
  your website dynamic and responsive. Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form
  an unbeatable team. Start your coding journey by learning these three, and
  you'll be well on your way to building amazing things on the web. Happy
  coding!
