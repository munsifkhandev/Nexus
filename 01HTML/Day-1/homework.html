<h1>Pablo Escobar: A Biography</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria (1949–1993) was a Colombian drug lord and
  narcoterrorist who founded and led the Medellín Cartel. At the height of his
  power, he was one of the wealthiest criminals in history, controlling a vast
  empire built on the global cocaine trade. His life was a paradoxical blend of
  extreme violence, immense wealth, and a populist public image.

<h2>Early Life and Rise to Power</h2>
<p>
  Born into a poor family in Rionegro, Colombia, Escobar's criminal career began
  with petty street crimes as a teenager. His early activities included stealing
  tombstones to resell, smuggling illegal cigarettes, and car theft. By the
  mid-1970s, he had fully entered the burgeoning cocaine trade. He and his
  associates formed a partnership that would become known as the Medellín
  Cartel. Through a combination of cunning business acumen and brutal violence,
  Escobar quickly dominated the cocaine market, establishing smuggling routes
  from South America to the United States. His infamous tactic was known as
  "plata o plomo," meaning "silver or lead"—a choice between accepting his
  bribes or facing a violent death.

<h2>The King of Cocaine</h2>
<p>
  By the 1980s, the Medellín Cartel controlled an estimated 80% of the world's
  cocaine market. This monopoly made Escobar one of the world's richest
  individuals, with a reported net worth of over $30 billion. His wealth allowed
  him to live a lavish lifestyle, owning multiple luxurious properties,
  including the renowned Hacienda Nápoles, a 7,000-acre estate that featured a
  zoo, an airstrip, and a private bullring. <br />
  <br />

  Despite his criminal activities, Escobar cultivated a "Robin Hood" image among
  Colombia's poor. He funded public works projects, building schools, hospitals,
  and housing in impoverished neighborhoods of Medellín, which earned him a
  degree of public support and a seat as an alternate member in the Colombian
  Congress in 1982.

<h2>The Downfall and Death</h2>
<p>
  Escobar's reign was marked by a campaign of terror against the Colombian
  government, law enforcement, and rival cartels, particularly the Cali Cartel.
  He was responsible for countless bombings, kidnappings, and assassinations of
  judges, politicians, and police officers in his fight against extradition to
  the United States.

  In 1991, Escobar surrendered to Colombian authorities, striking a deal that
  guaranteed he would not be extradited. He was housed in his own self-built
  luxurious prison, La Catedral. However, after it became clear he was still
  running his criminal empire from within, the government attempted to move him
  to a standard prison. Escobar escaped in July 1992, leading to a massive,
  nationwide manhunt involving the Colombian National Police, U.S. special
  forces, and the DEA. <br />
  <br />

  On December 2, 1993, a day after his 44th birthday, security forces located
  him in a middle-class neighborhood of Medellín. As they closed in, he
  attempted to escape by running across rooftops. He was killed by gunfire in
  the ensuing shootout. His death marked the end of the Medellín Cartel's
  dominance and the conclusion of his violent legacy.
